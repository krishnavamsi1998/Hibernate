You go to a market for shopping. This means you have created a session in market.

Now you are going to a shopkeeper to purchase item X. Here your transaction starts, you pick the item, pay the amount to the shopkeeper, get the change back and keep it in your pocket and leave the shop with item X. Your transaction is over.
